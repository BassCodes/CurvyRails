# Todo

- Make curve break when no blocks underneath
- Make block check on block updates and verify that structure of adjacent rails is valid; else break self.
- make "shape" block property constant for curve.
  (e.g. rails placed adjacent don't change curve's internal shape)
- Carts placed on curve don't immediately snap to curve (getpos maybe?)
- Unobtainable item with lore describing how to make curvy rails (for jei and such)
- Jank on 3x3 curves when cart transitions from one curve to another (perhaps boundary condition on cirlce math?).
