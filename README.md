# Curvy Rails

This mod adds a new corner rail variety called the **Curvy Rail**.

The Curvy Rail is a softer, more round version of the vanilla 90° rail corner.

## How to use

Create a vanilla 90° rail corner then Shift+RightClick on it with an empty hand.
The vanilla 90° corner is then replaced with this mod's curvy corner.

## Alpha

This mod is still in alpha and is prone to be buggy.
Please report any bugs on github or through discord.

## Compatibility

Curvy Rails are compatible with vanilla minecarts and should be compatible with other mod's carts.

In the worst case, another mod's carts will simply not function on Curvy Rails, but will work still on vanilla rails. This mod does not change the behavior of vanilla rails.

## Future Plans

- Bigger curves
- Smoother slopes
- Diagonal Rails
- different curve shapes
- better integration with Railcraft Reborn rail types.
